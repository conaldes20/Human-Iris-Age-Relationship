# Human Iris and Age Relationship
This software is meant to see if human age could be predicted using iris image. It is well known that human eye deteriorate with age. The accuracy of iris in the identification of a person makes it an important tool in biometrics. The project was looking at a feature voting, whereby under-age voting could be detected using iris images.

Deep Neural Network was used. After training, a captured iris image stored in temPics folder will be processed. Age is predicted and if it’s under-voting, the image is stored in acceptedPics folder, otherwise it get stored in rejectedPics folder.
